# How-To-Approach-Any-ML-Problem
In this repo I am trying to add how to start any ML problem. This repo will contain many different kind of datasets and many training model. Each of them will show how to work with regression, NLP, Multi-Class Problem, etc. Almost every training model will have three steps &lt;br/> 1.Data preprocessing <br /> 2. Data Traing loop <br /> 3. Data prediction / Data Post Processsing <br /> I will use python to write the code.
